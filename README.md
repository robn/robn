## Oh hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rob (he/him), an old time computer guy from Australia with interests in storage, hardware, operating systems, infrastructure software, embedded systems, networks and everything in between.

My current focus is on [OpenZFS](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs), because there's a lot of data out there and it'd be nice not to lose any of it.

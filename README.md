## Oh hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rob (he/him), an old time computer guy from Australia with interests in storage, hardware, operating systems, infrastructure software, embedded systems, networks and everything in between.

These days I'm working on [OpenZFS](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs), because there's a lot of data out there and it'd be nice not to lose any of it.

### Support my work on OpenZFS

OpenZFS is fantastic, but lots of parts of it don't get much love because there's no company interested in funding it, and individuals usually can't afford to hire a developer directly.

I'm trying to turn that around. If you see [something I did in OpenZFS](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Arobn) that you like, and you'd like to help out, why not send a little coin my way? Its not much yet, but I'm hoping after a while there will be enough there to help pay for a little extra time, hardware or just motivation.

Thanks a lot :)

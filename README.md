## Oh hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rob (he/him), an old time computer guy from Australia with interests in storage, hardware, operating systems, infrastructure software, embedded systems, networks and everything in between.

These days I'm working on [OpenZFS](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs), because there's a lot of data out there and it'd be nice not to lose any of it.

### Let's build OpenZFS together!

OpenZFS is **an open-source project with no single company behind it**, and so lives or dies through the generous support of its users. But, the needs of corporate users with massive amounts of storage hardware and money to spend are often not the same as what small organisations or power users want. The parts of OpenZFS that support those users often donâ€™t get much work because thereâ€™s no company interested in funding it, and **individuals can rarely afford to hire a developer directly**.

This is where you can help. I want to put some of my time into the unloved parts of OpenZFS and the surrounding community, to make sure it remains a viable option for anyone who is serious about their data. This takes many forms, from **making sure OpenZFS works well** as newer operating system updates arrive, to making sure lesser used features continue to work well; from answering questions and taking ideas, to presenting at user groups and conferences.

These things take time, money, or both, and your support will allow me to help keep OpenZFS available as **a modern, powerful data storage platform for all kinds of data and all kinds of users**.
